This project is making a model to predict which pokemon will win in 1 on 1 pokemon battle. 

## Requirement
We use python language and some third party library.

- pytorch

And we use datasets from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/terminus7/pokemon-challenge) under [CC0: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). If you want to execute this code, you should download 2 files (combats.csv and pokemon.csv) to the ./data directory.
